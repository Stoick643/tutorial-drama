  "technical_concept": "A branch is not a copy of your code. It is a tiny file containing a single 40-character hash pointing to a commit. Creating a branch is instant because Git copies nothing — it just writes a new pointer. HEAD is another pointer that tells Git which branch you're currently on. Merging brings one branch's commits into another — always switch to the target branch first.",
