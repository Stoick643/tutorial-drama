# Tutorial Drama

Learn Redis, SQL, Git, Docker, and more through story-driven tutorials. Detective Noir, Sci-Fi, Fairy Tales, Romance — same technical content, different narrative experiences.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running
python app/main.py
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Topics

| Topic | Lessons | What You Learn |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Redis | 5 | Key-value store: SET, GET, lists, sets, hashes |
| SQL | 6 | Queries: SELECT, WHERE, JOINs, aggregates |
| Git | 4 | Version control: status, staging, commits, branches |
| Docker | 6 | Containers: Dockerfiles, images, volumes, Compose |
| LLM | 6 | AI internals: tokens, embeddings, API calls (coming soon) |
| Bash | TBD | Linux command line (coming soon) |

## How It Works

1. Pick a topic and narrative style
2. Read the story dialogue — characters teach you the concept
3. Try the interactive challenge in the console
4. Get instant feedback from real code execution in Docker sandboxes
